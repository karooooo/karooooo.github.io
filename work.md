* This was one of my first projects ever on Photoshop
* It was mandatory that we create the shoe image, add colour and shadows
* Laslty creating a complementary background to match the shoes colours

* This is one of my favourite pieces
* The idea was putting "something" in a blank bottle
* My job was to add the water, island,rocks and sky in the bottle

* Although this piece looks very simple and easy, this arguably took the most time out of all the images on this list
* I was instructed to add multiple layers of shapes and layer each of them within the letter
* This image had about 6 layers within the letter

* This poster is supposed to be for a smoothie company
* I had to find images of fruits, apply a clip-mask, edit the background colours to implement that vibrant tropical scenery 
* Lastly, I was instructed to give the model a tan, edit the colours in her image and fit it all in the circle border
