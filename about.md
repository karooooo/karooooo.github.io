## About Me

<strong>I fell in love with UX design about a year ago; I have a passion for designing and innovating. I love to collab and work with others. I've always found it fascinating to analyze and study people's emotions and attitudes. I love to work on Photoshop and plan to expand my skills to other editing platforms this winter. Premiere Pro, Lightroom, Illustrator, AfterEffects, InDesign, and DreamWeaver are the ones I'm planning on pursuing after my first semester of university. In my free time, I enjoy boxing, skateboarding, listening to music, and making beats. I currently attend Wilfrid Laurier University for UX-Design, and I'm enjoying every minute of it! <strong>
